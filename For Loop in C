The for loop in C Language provides a functionality/feature to repeat a set of statements a defined number of times. The for loop is in itself a form of an entry-controlled loop.

Unlike the while loop and doâ€¦while loop, the for loop contains the initialization, condition, and updating statements as part of its syntax. It is mainly used to traverse arrays, vectors, and other data structures.
